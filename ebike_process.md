| Rationale | Finding the optimal material for an e-bike frame is crucial for balancing weight, strength, durability, and cost. A lighter frame improves handling and increases battery range, while high structural integrity enhances rider safety and comfort. Evaluating options such as aluminum alloys, carbon fiber, steel, or titanium is essential to ensure the e-bike meets design goals without compromising on performance or manufacturability. | | | |  | |
| User  Story | As a sustainability-focused entrepreneur, I want to research and select the most suitable frame material for my e-bike prototype, so that I can offer a lightweight, robust, and long-lasting product to environmentally conscious riders who seek maximum performance and safety. | | | Alex Redwood |

| Sample Extraction            | Obtain raw material or test coupons from bulk material or component.                                                 | Material Storage/Workshop                | Band Saw SawTek SX-200, Wire EDM Elecut WEDM-500                                                                           | John Smith      | 316L                                     | Sample TT-2025-003                         |
| Sample Preparation           | Machine the material into standardized tensile coupons per ASTM/ISO specs (e.g., grinding edges, polishing surfaces). Measure dimensions (length, width, thickness) to ensure compliance with test standards.     | Machine Shop, Metrology Lab              | Milling Machine MilliTech MX-7, Grinding/Polishing Equipment GrindPro GP-2000, Cleaning Station CleanMax CM-100, Caliper Preciso CLP-10, Micrometer MeasureMate MMC-15, Coordinate Measuring Machine MetriScan CMM-700 | Alicia Brown    | Sample TT-2025-003                       | Sample TT-2025-003                         |
| Measurement process                 | Mount sample in tensile tester; apply load until fracture, recording stress-strain data.                             | Testing Lab                              | Tensile Testing Machine Tensilix TTX-5000, Extensometer Extensio EXT-50, Load Cell ForceMax FC-20K                          | Carlos Ramirez  | Sample TT-2025-003                       | Tensile test raw  TT-2025-00 3                     |
| Sample Inspection | Inspect fracture surfaces, check for defects, and note failure modes (e.g., necking, cup-and-cone fracture). Output inspection data is reported in the raw data set from measurement process (out of simplicity).       | Metrology Lab | Optical microscope, stereoscope                                                                                             | Sophie Wilson   | Sample TT-2025-003 |  Tensile test raw  TT-2025-003                         |
| Data Processing              | Process collected force-extension data into stress-strain curves; calculate mechanical properties (UTS, yield strength, elongation). |                       |           Tensile Test Analysis App                                                | Lisa Meyer      | Tensile test raw  TT-2025-003                   | *create new item here with tensile strength: 330, elongation: 0.083, youngs modulus: 193 GPa*        |
| Result analysis                    | 316L stainless steel provides a balance of moderate strength and good ductility, which can handle the everyday stresses of e-bike use while offering dependable impact absorption. Its corrosion resistance also contributes to long-term durability, even in challenging environments. However, the added weight compared to lighter metals or composite materials could affect efficiency and maneuverability, so choosing 316L largely depends on whether corrosion protection and overall robustness outweigh the emphasis on reduced weight. |              |                                                                                       |                 |      *use new outcome kitem from previous step*     |                                        |
